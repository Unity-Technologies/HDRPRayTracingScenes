# Requirements
NVIDIA RTX series card with the latest drivers [here](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=com)
Windows 10 RS5 (Build 1809) or later

Ray tracing hardware acceleration is only available on certain graphics cards. The graphics cards with full support are:

NVIDIA Volta (Titan X)
NVIDIA Turing RTX (2060, 2070, 2080, and their TI variants)
NVIDIA also provides a ray tracing fallback for some other generation graphics cards:

NVIDIA Turing GTX (1660 and 1660 Ti)
NVIDIA Pascal (1060, 1070, 1080 and their TI variants)
If your computer has one of these graphics cards, it can run ray tracing in Unity.

Before you open Unity, make sure to update your NVIDIA drivers to the latest version, and also make sure your Windows version is at least 1809.

FAQ:
- I get "this application won't work on this computer" when running Unity.exe
